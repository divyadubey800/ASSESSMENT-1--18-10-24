# Web Dev Assignment - Simple Webpage

**Date:** 18/10/2024  
**Assignment:** First Web Development Project  
**Description:** This is my first web development assignment, where I created a simple webpage featuring a background, an image with a meme, and a text caption.

## Project Overview

This webpage is designed with simplicity in mind and includes the following elements:
- A background image or color for visual appeal.
- A front image featuring a meme with the caption:  
  **"That Special Moment When you find the perfect avocado at the supermarket."**
- Below the meme, there is a short text description related to the meme.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To structure the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For basic styling, including background and layout adjustments.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Assessment-1--18-10-24.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the webpage.
